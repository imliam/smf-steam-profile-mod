This modification allows each user to insert their Steam User ID in the "Forum Profile" section of their Profile Modification, which will then come up with a small Steam Icon in three places:

 � Profile Page
 � Memberlist
 � Post Profile

[i]Note: This does not add the column to the memberlist in [b]1.1.X[/b], however it does in [b]2.0[/b][/i]

If you already have any other modifications installed on your website that modifies the MemberList, this modification may not work, however it has been tested with a variety of other modifications and works perfectly. Install this via the package manager, it only edits few files and extracts one.

[b]SMF 1.1.X: [/b]Installing this modification for SMF 1.1.X will only edit the template files. For all themes other than the default, just copy the "steam.gif" file to "/Themes/YourTheme/images" folder.

[b]SMF 2.0: [/b]It should install smoothly for SMF 2.0, however you will have to check the checkboxes for each other theme that you want it installed for; "Install In Other Themes" Option when installing the package.
